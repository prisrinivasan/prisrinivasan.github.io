### About me

My name is Priyanka Srinivasan, a recent MPH graduate in Biostatistics and Health Policy & Practice from Columbia University. My bottom-line goal here is to learn something new.

Professionally, I'm interested in learning how to use analytical tools to tackle problems within the healthcare system. My current personal obsessions include reading thriller/horror [books](https://www.goodreads.com/priyankasrinivasan), learning and teaching yoga, playing with animals, and human rights advocacy. For information on my academic and professional experience, feel free to view my [resume](./resume.html). You can find more about the dashboard data [here](./dashboard.html).

### Nice things

I don't have any pets of my own, but here is [Rafa](https://www.instagram.com/rafa._nadog/), my uncle's dog, as well as a silly goat I made friends with this summer.
